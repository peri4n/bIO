# bIO - A search engine for sequence data

The bIO project aims to provide a search engine for sequence data (Imagine googling your genome). We are 
perfectly aware of tools like BLAST allow you to search through giant data sets, but these tools have there 
problems:

- They do not scale - at least in a Big Data sense
- They are not easily set up for private use
- They lack a good user interface

We try to solve all of there problems using modern approaches and best practices.

## Quick Overview

At its heart bIO is a web application. It uses the [play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) in it's backend and [react](https://reactjs.org/) in the front end.

The project is structured into different subprojects to enforce a clean separation of code between the 
different layers:

- `webapp` contains all the logic associated with the web application (including javascript)
- `codec` contains code to parses the different supported formats

## Getting Stared

Running this application requires [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/), an interactive build tool for tasks written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).

```
git clone https://github.com/peri4n/bIO.git
cd bIO
sbt webapp/run
```
